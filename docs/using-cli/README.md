# Using Vue-cli

In this part we will make use of Vue-cli to build the application we did in part one. I think this will show the power when using the cli tool and single file components (SFC).

## Chapter 1 - It begins

First we need to have vue-cli installed. Following the [installation guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

We can now create a new project by

```bash
vue create my-example-project
```

This will ask some questions about how your project will be created. We will create our project a bit of overkill using unit testing, vuex and vue-router.
Using to give a bit of the different approaches you can go using a Vue project.
