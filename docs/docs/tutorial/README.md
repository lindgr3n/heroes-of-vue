# Tutorial
Inspired by Angulars [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial#tutorial-tour-of-heroes) i thougt i would make my own twist on it and in the same time honor some of the people behind Vue! So here is the story of the heroes of Vue!

In this first part we will build the application using just one file! Crazy you would say. No node_modules black hole :O Just bare with me :)

Full application exist here [demo](https://heroes-of-vue.netlify.com). Checkout the repo [here](https://github.com/lindgr3n)
